## How to use this?

Just link **javascript.js** and **style.css** to the website's page(s) that will be freezed.

## How to change the timer?

By default it is given 30 seconds that means the website will be freezed after 30 seconds of fully loaded. To change the timer just go to *15th* line of **javascript.js** file and change *30000* to the targeted number (it is represented as nano-seconds, where 1 second = 1000 ns)
